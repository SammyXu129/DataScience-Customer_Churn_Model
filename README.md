# Customer Churn Metric Dashboard and Prediction Model

## Project Background
Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned therefore it is necessary to know more about customers in advance who is at risk of churning. By defining Key KPIs and metrics, I developed the dashboards to visualizes customer demographics and insights. In order to increase customer retention, I developed and deployed classification models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic) achieving 85% accuracy in predicting customer churn and also omplementing survival analysis techniques to estimate customer lifetime value, resulting in an improvement in marketing spend allocation and an increase in customer retention rates.
